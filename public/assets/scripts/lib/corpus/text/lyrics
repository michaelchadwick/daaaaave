So will I ever understand
The flow of the river, the lay of the land
Doing the dance we were taught long ago
We cling to our treasures, we won't let them go (we won’t let them go)

Sometimes illusion can keep us content
We look for some pleasure as we just make the rent
Searching for answers when the question is gray
It's all in the course of your average day

And you are inside of me, as the world we shape breaks free
And the triggers in our head, keep us dangling by a thread

Comfort is a distraction...breeding inaction...and dissatisfaction

Can we reach beyond today
To grasp a fate so far away
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Can our spirits be unchained

So will I ever feel complete
We look to advance but so often retreat
Lofty ideals that have guided my way
Fade to the background as we live day to day (we live day to day)

Little obsessions that consume all our thoughts
Reaching for life lines get us tied up in knots
Looking for something that might open the door
Sitting and watching as we wish we had more

And you are a part of me, as we try to find the key
But the habits in our mind, seem to keep us deaf and blind

Life lived as a reaction...to every infraction...is endless distraction

Can we reach beyond today
To grasp a fate so far away
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Can our spirits be unchained

Get off your big rump, and hit the dance flo’
Grab your best girl, give those heels a twirl
Watch the whole club hop, with the moves you got
Act like a foo, whatchoo got to lose?

Get up, get back down, just like you did before
Shut it! and I mean you, not the club door
Talk is through, move your body round
Wipe the frown off yo face, ‘fore you hit the ground!

Swing like a tree, fall like a leaf, float like a web, it’s what Charlotte said

Losin’ myself in the music and dance
Lookin’ in your eyes, I fall in a trance
Tryin’ to get by, and I'm tryin’ to survive
Moving my body, I forget all the lies

Groove on the big strings, with his funky sound
D on the bass, Denver ain't the town
Swinging my body, on the dance floor
I think I know, what these legs are for

Swing like a tree, fall like a leaf, float like a web, it’s what Charlotte said

Gimme some room, to feel this brand-new beat
Shaking her rump, my girl, she came up...off...the street
She knows the moves that chase the blues away
Fatty drum beats, I'm-a, I’m-a watchin’ Rusty play

Tommy ain't two tone, he just laying it down
On his guitar, he play dat rockin’ sound
My name is Mike, I make a stand
Ask you now, how you like my band?

Swing like a tree, fall like a leaf, float like a web, it’s what Charlotte said

They start a war, to hide their tracks,
Cover with sand and bury the past.
Keep the secret, from generations on,
They pass the knowledge in their mystery school songs!

Maybe in a parable, maybe in a verse,
It's always right in front of you, that's just the way it works.
They say it in a way, that leads you astray,
Where are the stars on any given day?

Planters beat the herders... they'll always need more,
Growing population, while killing in war.
It's a delicate balance, struck in a cathedral,
Choosing who will live is knowing good and evil!

They make us choose between two sides
Put on a show while working the inside
Cast the blame on the ones they abuse
Just hear them laughing as they pull off their ruse

With the eye in the sky, decreed from up above,
Anything but filled with love.
This may sound a little insane,
Like learning to dock an airship!

The morning light hits my face
Roll out of bed, hit the floor
Last night’s trials come full circle
Blow it away, don’t need it anymore

All I want right now
Is for the tire to meet the road
When the past is outta sight
Then the past can finally told

Light meets shadow
Give meets take
Muscles are burning, mind ain’t clear
Say hello to the demon, goodbye to the fear

As long as I can move
As long as I can fly
As long as I can find the route
Then I’m not yet...down and out

Check the mirror once again
Who will I be today?
Itchin’ and scratchin’ and clawin’ around
The pendulum will hopefully swing my way

All I want right now
Is for my fire to burn the road
When the past is all gone
Then the past can finally be explode

Light meets shadow
West meets east
Pistons are pumping, the sky is clear
Hello, Mr. Demon, goodbye Mr. Fear

As long as I can move
As long as I can fly
As long as I can find the route
Then I’m not yet...down and out

Challenge me
Take me on an adventure
Where the blue of the sea meets the blue of the sky

Defend me
Against trials fact or fake
Breathe real deep now, cuz you are free

Salty eyes
Briney lips
The vasty deep is where Poseidon lies

Reject me
So I can push back against ya
Open up and swallow it all, once again

Funnel me
Into a world that I can feel
Sinking into my mind, deconstruction time

Salty eyes
Briney lips
The vasty deep is where Poseidon lies

The maelstrom comes
Blows me away
Even Tide is pandemonium

Fudge and jam go together like
Ram-a-lam go together like
Jim and Pam go together like
Son of Sam go together like
Cheese and ham go together like
Wig and wam go together like
Master and plan go together like
Yin and yang

They all go together like each other

Fudge and jam go together like
Spic and span go together like
Boom and bam go together like
Flim and flam go together like
Glitz and glam go together like
Pearl and clam go together like
Made and man...well
I yam what I yam

What I’m trying to say is that
Well, that everything goes together
Peace and love, cry from a dove
Work hard, play hard
Live long, live strong
Be sure to end it with a gong

Even things that don’t match
Well, they certainly can still mix
Fix it, nix it, grab a friend and remix it
Grow it, show it, find some tyranny and overthrow it
In the end, it’s all the same
Feed your mind, feed your brain

Take a bucket, pull out a thang
Grab another, do it again
Plug in, come on let’s hang
Hit record, put the act in a frame

Fudge and jam, ya’ll
Major Tom, The D, and Rus-T (and MC) are Fudge and Jam!

I’ve been down in this hole so long I can’t recall
Another way to live outside of these four walls
I’m reaching up to find a rung that I can grab
To lift me out of all this emptiness and drab

I know there’s got to be a little light above my head
I know I’ve got to climb this ladder now before I’m dead
There’s something burning in my soul and I can’t turn away
I’ve had enough of darkness this is not where I will stay

I thought I knew it all and I was in control
I burned the candle at both ends, it took its toll
And as the shadows started filling up my space
I realized I lost my way, I fell from grace

I know there’s got to be a little light above my head
I know I’ve got to climb this ladder now before I’m dead
There’s something burning in my soul and I can’t turn away
I’ve had enough of darkness this is not where I will stay

What's wrong this time?
It's never right
You can't be satisfied
You're so uptight

Let it go now, c'mon c'mon
Let it be now, c'mon c'mon

Just get off your high horse and open your mind
There's so much that you can't begin to unwind
Life comes in a package with baggage, it's heavy, it's heavy, it's so very heavy
So quit your complaining, it's draining, it's draining, it's so very draining

So you're unhappy
What else is new?
You're always finding fault
In all I do

Let it go now, c'mon c'mon
Let it be now, c'mon c'mon

Just get off your high horse and open your mind
There's so much that you can't begin to unwind
Life comes in a package with baggage, it's heavy, it's heavy, it's so very heavy
So quit your complaining, it's draining, it's draining, it's so very draining

Walking down the road, it’s so easy to see
That you don’t need me
I am so lost that I can’t breathe
Trying to leave, but I don’t know where to go

And I’m going down
And I’m losing ground
And I’m outta sound

Things were really clear way back when
Seemed to know just where I was headin’
Well, guess what? The future is now
And I got no more than I had back then

I don’t know how I got here
And I don’t know how I’m gonna get out
There’s another way for me to feel relief
Gotta run on, gotta keep on, gotta keep myself together now

I don’t know but I have this fear
And it weighs me down, down, down
There’s another way to feel whole today
Gotta run on, gotta keep on, gotta let myself go now

Can you follow me down this road
I may not know where I'm going to go
But I've got all that I need with me
And hittin' the road is gonna set me free

As I look out across the fields
I hear the hum of my spinning wheels
All my troubles are left behind
The road is helping me clear my mind

So this is life
You just can't make the grade
And you're afraid you're going to fade away
You're not alone
So many others feel the same
And we all try to find our way, get through the maze

As the miles just pass away
I start to think about yesterday
The things I said that I can't take back
So now I'm taking a different tack

See the faces in all the cars
Hiding all of their secret scars
They’re all trying to get someplace
But I’m just looking to get some space

Settle down as you drive on
Feel the road as you keep on
See the world through the window
See the places that you might go

You can glance in the mirror
But don't get stuck if you see her
Though the clouds are upon you
Soon the sun, it will break through

I can't recall what it was that drove me away,
Watching this life like a game that I don't have to play.
It's from this seat, that I read, and I watch, and I judge,
Locked in my fear, I'm a prisoner here, I won't budge

These are just scenes that I saw while I sat at my window.
I sat in my chair as I watched all the people go by,
Viewed from behind the glass, surveying slices of life,
These are the scenes that played out as I watched through my window.

I see the faces, familiar and strange, passing by
Some full of life and some others look ready to die
Kids playing games as the elderly wish they were young
I sit and watch and I listen as church bells are rung

I've seen families start, broken hearts,
Trees losing leaves, wives bereaved,
Tickets and pickets, and punks saying 'Stick it'
So many things while my life just stood still.

I’ve seen cars driving by and planes in the sky
People keep moving as I’m standing by
Laughter and crying and whispers and screams
They struggle each day as they all chase their dreams

They rise up in victory then fall to the floor
Winning the prize and then wanting for more
Running and crawling, they all make their way
But here I keep sitting as life slips away

Anchors aweigh, time to go
Another trip, but no bags to stow

Time, well, it flitters and flutters
And life, it jitters and stutters

Get on deck, grab a rail
Dig in deep, beyond the pale

Your mind, it’s drifting and floating
The shore, it’s slowly eroding

And as you start to part the sea
Just remember that you and me
We sail on this vessel together
And we’ll make it home tonight

Stroll along the waves, the swell is in your mind
Take a seat, for now, just unwind

The clouds, they’re rolling and scrolling
And the bells, well, they’re tolling and tolling

Make no plans, the journey’s the destination
It’s getting clear, as you arrive at the station

This ship, it’s twisting and turning
On the brine, that’s blistering and burning

And as you start to part the sea
Just remember that you and me
We sail on this vessel together
And we’ll make it home tonight

She’s got a bad tattoo on the back of her neck
It’s gotten so bad I can feel its breath
It looks like a vato with a large cabeza
I’ll send that melon into outer space-a

High on her arm she’s got the seven sisters
My eyes saw stars, and my hands had blisters
Big ol’ blisters, hotter than her sister
My name is Mike, and I can’t resist her

She’s got a ticket to ride, but will she let us
Turns out my girl has got a tattoo fetish

Start at the ankle and work my way up
It's some kind of hairy thing, maybe a pup
As I go in deeper to her inner thigh
I come across a cyclops with one pink eye

She laid her trap, and it was fly like venus
But to my surprise, out popped a --
WHOA! You all know I’m just kidding, right? Ain't no funny business here
Bring it around boys, and hit me with the chorus

She’s got a ticket to ride, but will she let us
Turns out my girl has got a tattoo fetish

Tat...tat-too-oo, tat...tat-too-oo, tat...tat-too-oo, tat

As I rolled over to see the small of her back
I saw the tramp stamp, it was a cold six pack
Big ol’ blisters, hotter than her sisters
My name’s still Mike, and I still can’t resist her
(Come on and hit me with the chorus!)

She’s got a ticket to ride, but will she let us
Turns out my girl has got a tattoo fetish

Tat...tat-too-oo, tat...tat-too-oo, tat...tat-too-oo, tat
Tat...tat-too-oo, tat...tat-too-oo, tat...tat-too-oo, tat

Well I’m about to come undone, it’s never fun, like a loaded gun, I want to run
I got to take it slow, try not to react, I try to lay it back and keep my vibe intact
So I keep the time, and make it rhyme, ‘cuz they’re pushing my buttons all of the time
I like to count if off, my lucky seven, maybe this time, it’s eleven

Gang stalkers
Gas lighters
They build the tension
Groups of three, they give release!

Well he’s about to come undone, we’re having fun, like a loaded gun, we just begun
Like a bird in my hand, you got two in her bush, state degreed haze, my job is to push
Gonna strip him, and rip him, and put in a ring, ‘til he loses grip, like an unwound string
He likes to count if off, his number seven, maybe this time, it’s eleven

Gang stalkers
Gas lighters
They build the tension
Groups of three, they give release!

He’s being followed, he’s got the willies
We’re saying these things, about him, Yeah!

I’m being followed, I’ve got the willies
They’re saying these things, about me? Yeah! It’s me.

He’s being followed, he’s got the willies
We’re saying these things, about him, Yeah!

Followed!
Willies!
Saying things!
Me/Him Yeah!

I look through this window
Clouded with rain
I dream of a meadow
Far, far away

A glimmer of starlight
Catches my eye
A light I connect to
Wondering why

Wondering why, wondering why

The love - it's buried in your soul
The flame you hide burns out of control
The pain you feel when we're far apart
The time we spend we owe to our heart

I float on this river
It's taking me home
A life of connection
Never alone

The way that you look at me
Says everything
The thoughts in our heads
The questions we bring

The love - it's buried in your soul
The flame you hide burns out of control
The pain you feel when we're far apart
The time we spend we owe to our heart
